extensible-client-server
=======================

This is a proof of concept (sample) of an application that is extensible by addition vs modification. In other words, functionality is added to the Node.js server and the Angular.js client by adding files.

Goals:

* Upgrades should not require re-installation of extensions
* Extensions should be upgradable by simply replacing files
* The extensibility model should be simple, while remaining as flexible as possible

This project will evolve as I discover better ways to achieve these goals.
